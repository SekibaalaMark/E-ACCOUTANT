# My React Frontend

This project is a React application that serves as the frontend for a Django API. It is built using TypeScript and demonstrates how to interact with the backend API.

## Project Structure

```

├── public
│   └── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── src
│   ├── App.tsx          # Main component of the application
│   ├── index.tsx        # Entry point of the application
│   ├── components
│   │   └── ExampleComponent.tsx  # Example component to interact with the API
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts     # TypeScript types and interfaces
├── package.json          # npm configuration file
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The main component is located in `src/App.tsx`, where you can set up routing and application structure.
- The entry point of the application is `src/index.tsx`, which renders the App component.
- You can create additional components in the `src/components` directory to build out your application.
- Use the `src/types/index.ts` file to define TypeScript interfaces for API responses and other data structures.
